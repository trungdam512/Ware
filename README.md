# Project description:
Our project features a traditional Burkina Faso game, which includes two players placing and taking turns to move 3 markers. Our code requires users to install Java 17 to use kilt-graphics, a graphic library developed by the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science (MSCS) department in Macalester College: https://mac-comp127.github.io/kilt-graphics/index.html.

To play the game, users should first log their name into name boxes. Then the game takes the players to a board screen, which requires them to place 3 markers by turn. Using a computer mouse, one player must move their markers smartly to form a row, a column, or a diagonal line to win the game. The players can further change their names and play the game over again.

# Known Issues and Ideas for Further Implementation:
There is nothing that happens when a player does not apply the game rules; they would not be able to place their marker for example if they put it on a spot which already has a marker on it.
Once the player click on the instructions/change name button when they are already playing, the game will restart when they come back to play again 
The lines below the names might not fit well if the name is long, therefore it is preferable to use short names just for aesthetic purposes
For a mac user, they need to change the images files to a jpg format in order for it to be shown when the game is run
The player with the red color always start first. However players can change who is going by changing the order of names manually. 
The way players play the game sometimes can be annoying since two players have to use the same mouse cursor in the same device.

# Societal impact:
We did a good job of spreading Burkina Faso traditional game to many other communities and players.
We realize that our game is based on visual aspects such as the color of our markers and their movements. With this said, people with visual disabilities such as blindness and color blindness would have trouble playing our game.
Our game is a representation of our humor and we used this to express ourselves through our work. With this being said, there are some instances in our game where the language might be a trigger for some people like, “GIVE ME YOUR NAME” or “[instert name] SUCKS!!!”. This might have psychological effects on the users in a negative way. Our game could also be used to be a catalyst for a hostile, competitive environment with language usage. That is not the intention of our project, but an unintended potential consequence. It could be used against people in social settings if they want to bring up the outcomes of our games and the label that was assigned to them for losing the game as well.
